# MacUnwand

Opera wand being finicky and not realizing you’ve already saved your login information?  Forgot your saved username and/or password for a website?

MacUnwand is designed to decrypt the login/password information stored by Opera web browser.  Opera records the login information such as username and password for websites authorized by the user and stores them in the database file ‘wand.dat’ in encrypted format.  MacUnwand decrypts and displays the url, username, and password from this file.  The sign on information can be saved as a csv file for easy reference.

# Features

* Drag and Drop ‘wand.dat’ files onto the application to decrypt the data.
* Save wand data into CSV file for easy reference.
* Find data quickly using the search filter.
